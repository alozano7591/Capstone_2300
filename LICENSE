NOTE:
This license was chosen for this project since I do not want to have an open source license.
I browsed github's library of licenses and came to the conclusion that any open source license
would give people too much power to replicate and use this code as they wish, which 
would leave the project with no protections against misuse and abuse.

This license essentially intends to give users the right to contribute and even view code, 
but not reproduce, copy, or use for their own work or projects. This also reserves the right
to monetize off of all work in this project.

This is a modified version of the standard MIT license which was chosen due to its simplicity.
